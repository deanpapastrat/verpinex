## Development Plan
1. Design UI and UX in Sketch. Refine user stories and perfect the experience on an abstract level.
2. Review user stories with marketers, designers, and non-technical people. Find the places they don't understand and simplify.
3. Model the data while keeping future ideas in mind, to make it easily scalable and expandable. Make it easy to integrate with a typical REST API so that Verpinex could eventually sync to a server as well as the browser.
4. Initialize the main project files using Ember.js and PouchDB
5. Write all low-level operations and build helpers that abstract it so the UI is simple and clean.
6. Write the HTML/JS/CSS exporter. Test it extensively with practice data. Refine any issues with models. (use Blob API/saveAs)
7. Make wrapper interface, including home, index, etc.
8. Make page editor.
9. Make site editor.
10. Finish loose ends.
11. Alpha release.
12. Fix all bugs from alpha.
13. Beta release.
14. Fix all bugs from beta, add some features from feature requests.
15. Release v1.0.0
